# How did i made that?

50% of these things are learned from web or completed by copilot because i forgot some CSS options (because my web devolopment skills collected dust) or learned how to change css styles using JS. But 0% of them is not ChatGPT. Yipee!

# Usage?

You can write a small program that will make a widget with this "masterpiece"

# How it works?

Pretty Simple! It gets date and time and puts them into text (that is by default set to "00:00:00 00/00/0000")
The black/light mode thing also is simple. when you click the button it replaces the current CSS file to another using 2 (1 default and 1 alternate) CSS files with one of themes on one of them.
